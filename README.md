Create a New Branch (optional but recommended):

It's a good practice to work on a separate branch instead of directly on the main branch. This keeps things organized, especially if you're working with others or on multiple features.
bash
Copy
git checkout -b feature-branch-name
Replace feature-branch-name with a name related to the feature you are working on, like job-posting-feature or user-authentication.
